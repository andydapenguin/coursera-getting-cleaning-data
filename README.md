# Getting & Cleaning Data Course Project
Week 3 Project - Due 2015-08-23 at 4:30PM PST

##Project Overview
The project was designed for students to demonstrate our ability to *collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.*

##Summary of files
In this repo, I provide my run_analysis.R script that will produce the tidy_data.txt file. The text file is available for comparison to the script file. I also make available a codebook.md file that explains in more detail the raw data used, and the methods for data-processing.

* README.md - this file
* codebook.md - a detailed description of the raw data collection, features, and the analysis script
* run_analysis.R - the analysis script that operates on the raw data from the UCI study
* tidy_data.txt - a sample output file of the run_analysis.R script

###Notes
Please note not all the files used in this project are cotanined within this repo. Complete information on the study that generated the raw data as well as complete details on the experiment and methods may be accessed from the University of California, Irvine at the link below:
